UFO_SIGHTINGS
	
Sightings of UFO's around the world, geo-located and mapped on to Google Earth using Google Geolocation API (Cloud Console). This shows how many people around the world saw (thought they saw) unidentified flying objects as of 2/9/2019. The data was compiled from the National UFO Reporting Center and had 110,265 individual data. The data was scraped from their website and cleaned for geolocation. We made use of the Geolocation API on the Gooogle Cloud console to get the representation of these locations on earth and plotted it visually in Google Maps.
